# 🌌 VoAIge Xplorer  
### The Ultimate AI-Powered Travel Companion

VoAIge Xplorer is a next-generation travel planning platform built to make exploring the world feel effortless, visual, and deeply personal. Instead of overwhelming users with walls of text, the app brings each journey to life through immersive visuals, real-time intelligence, and an elegant anti-gravity UI that feels as light as the idea of travel itself.

This project was developed as part of the **Google AI Agents Intensive Capstone**, blending creative design with grounded AI tooling to build a genuinely future-ready travel companion.
